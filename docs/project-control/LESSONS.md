- Never use runner start time or latest report to infer transaction identity. Date and slot are supplied once.
- any(generator) short-circuits mutation: process every item, aggregate changed afterward.
- Immutable snapshots must deep-freeze nested values, not merely freeze the outer object.
- Whole-body comparison must not hide a terminal punctuation mismatch.
- Report-level snapshots must remain separate from independent live dashboard data.
