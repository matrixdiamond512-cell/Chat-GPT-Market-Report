# Foundation implementation — 2026-10-04

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Resolve SC-01–03 in the five formal Drive v1.8 documents, then implement immutable ReportContext → MarketDataSnapshot → ReportObject → G0–G8 validation foundations and the explicitly authorized P0 regression fixes.

ACTIVE PROFILE: dashboard + data-tool. Base commit: 600a533. Branch: codex/report-foundation-a-b-d-c.

ACCEPTANCE: Explicit dates, immutable retry identity, unknown-cron rejection, weekend new-report rejection; frozen report-bound snapshots; typed numeric markets and legacy read adapter; connected gates with PNG/manifest refusal, full-text Drive verification, rollback/projection/DOM checks; required A/B/D/C fixtures and existing regression checks; five formal Drive readbacks; unchanged production artifact hashes.

CONSTRAINTS: Preserve acquisition, readiness, history, source registry and legacy reads. No push/deploy or production JSON/report Docs/PNG/Receipt mutation. Formal specification updates are expressly authorized. 2026-10-02_21-00 remains UNRESOLVED / UNVERIFIED / NEEDS_REVIEW.

OUT OF SCOPE: E–H Publisher/Projection/Portal/Scheduler reorganization; production persist writer behavior change; canonical identity reconciliation.

FORBIDDEN SUBSTITUTE: Unit checks or new gate API do not prove that the existing live publishing pipelines enforce these gates. Report remaining deployment bypass separately.

OPEN OUTCOMES: None within the authorized A/B/D/C foundation task. Deferred: live Publisher/Projection/Portal/Scheduler enforcement, unresolved 2026-10-02_21-00 identity, existing unsafe canonical writer, historical structure/PNG gaps. These are not silently withdrawn.

NEXT ACTION: Foundation accepted at 0e14412. Phase E dry-run authorized below; prior deferred production outcomes remain open.

## Phase E — 2026-10-06 (ADD)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: In an offline fixture, safely bind Docs, PNG, immutable Manifest, Git registration and post-verification Receipt to one transaction, resume durable checkpoints without duplicate effects, and reject identity drift.

ACTIVE PROFILE: data-tool + generic-app. Start commit c6d1236.

ACCEPTANCE: Required identity fields, same-fileId full-text readback and approved normalization, actual fixture PNG bytes, immutable prepublication Manifest, lost-Git-response reconciliation, all five crash fixtures, same-identity duplicate prevention, stale/changed identity rejection, protected-slot read-only proof, unchanged production evidence.

CONSTRAINTS: Offline design and fixture implementation only. No production connection, Drive writes (including formal docs), push, deployment, production JSON/PNG/Receipt changes. No Phase F–H implementation. Never certify either OLD/NEW ID for 2026-10-02_21-00.

OPEN OUTCOMES: E-01 durable identity/state; E-02 Docs/PNG/Manifest/Git/Receipt connections; E-03 crash/retry/error/duplicate fixtures; E-04 fixed-candidate sweep, regression and safety proof; E-05 architecture/schema/report. Prior protected identity, unsafe writer and live enforcement risks remain deferred.

OUT OF SCOPE: Real Drive/GitHub/Pages adapters, production publication, projection migration, body reformatting, scheduler/portal changes.

FORBIDDEN SUBSTITUTE: Simulated Git SHA/Pages/DOM evidence must never be presented as a real commit, deployment or verified production publication.

NEXT NECESSARY ACTION: Build the offline publisher, sweep a fixed candidate, accept all specified failure/recovery scenarios, report and stop before Phase F.
